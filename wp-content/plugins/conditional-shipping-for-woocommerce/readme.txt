Restrict WooCommerce shipping methods based on conditions. Works with your existing shipping methods and zones.

== Description ==
Conditional Shipping for WooCommerce allows you to restrict shipping methods based on conditions. For example, you can disable free shipping for orders weighing over 30 kg or create a special shipping method for large products.

The plugin works with your existing shipping methods and zones. You can restrict flat rate, free shipping, pickup or any other shipping method created with shipping zones.

= Example =

You have two flat rate shipping methods, Freight and Economy. Orders weighing under 30 kg are shipped with Economy shipping. Orders over 30 kg have to be shipped with Freight.

With Conditional Shipping you can set maximum weight (30 kg) for Economy and minimum weight for Freight (30 kg). The customer sees only the right shipping on the checkout.

== Installation ==
Conditional Shipping is installed just like any other WordPress plugin.

1. Download the plugin zip file
2. Go to Plugins in the WordPress admin panel
3. Click Add new and Upload plugin
4. Choose the downloaded zip file and upload it
5. Activate the plugin

Once the plugin is activated, you can create rulesets at *WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Conditions*. Each ruleset comprises of conditions and actions which are run if conditions pass.

There is a debug mode which is really helpful to see how rulesets are working. You can activate it at *WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Conditions > Debug mode*. Once the mode is activated, you should be able to see *Conditional Shipping Debug* in the checkout which shows which conditions passed and actions were taken.

If you have dynamic / live shipping rates such as USPS, you will need to use **Match by name** option for selecting dynamic shipping methods. Please see [here](https://wptrio.com/guide/control-live-shipping-rates-e-g-usps-or-fedex/) for more information.

That should be all. Any questions / issues / bug reports feel free to create a post on [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/conditional-shipping-for-woocommerce/).
