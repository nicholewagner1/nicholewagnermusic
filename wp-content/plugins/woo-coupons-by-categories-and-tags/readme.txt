== Description ==

Did you ever feel the need to keep your WooCommerce coupons tidy? Like a way of grouping/sorting them, for example into folders to keep ones created for affiliates, ones created for promotions, and ones created to say sorry separate?

This plugin makes it VERY EASY to manage 100s of coupons by allowing you to **add Categories & Tags to your WooCommerce coupons**. Just like you add tags & categories to a post or page or to a WooCommerce product, you can do so even to your WooCommerce coupons.

This plugin will add 2 meta boxes on the Add/Edit Coupon page: one meta box for Tags & another one for Category. 

The admin can add multiple tags to a coupon & remove them. It is also possible to assign Category to coupons, including child categories.

The tags & coupons are displayed in 2 columns on the Coupons page. Clicking on a tag or category will filter all the coupons accordingly.
